Homely MQTT Bridge
==================

This project uses the Homely API to collect various data about sensors and alarms in the Homely system and publishes them to an MQTT broker.
It is primarily developed with `mqtt-exporter`_ in mind.

The Homely API is available for subscribers from `Homely support`_ upon request.
